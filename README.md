# Spring AI RAG Lab

A personal engineering lab to explore Enterprise RAG patterns using Java 21, Spring AI, and Local LLMs.
The goal is to move beyond simple chatbots and focus on system reliability, observability, and cost-performance trade-offs.

## Structure

*   `backend/`: Spring Boot 3.4+ application (Java 21 Virtual Threads)
*   `frontend/`: React + Tailwind CSS (Planned for Phase 4)

## Journal

**2026-01-18**
Initialized the project. Decided to start with a Monorepo structure to accommodate future frontend work.
Core stack:
*   Java 21 (Virtual Threads)
*   Spring AI (Milestone 5)
*   PostgreSQL + pgvector (Dockerized)
*   Ollama (Local LLM First)

Prioritizing a robust engineering approach over quick features.
Checking build environment... using Gradle 9.3.
